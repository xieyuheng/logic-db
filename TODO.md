# examples

- clause-and-effect
  - worksheet-08-maximum-of-a-list.test.ts

- the-power-of-prolog
  - water-jug-problem.test.ts

- sicp
  - a-boston-high-tech-company.test.ts
  - logic-as-programs.test.ts

# later

- well typed `projection` of query result -- with the help of `ty`

  - we need to accept `Var`

  - but our `ne` can not.

- `Db`
- `Db` -- stream
- `Db` -- cache
- `Db` -- index
- `Connection`

- error handling

# maybe

  - test by worksheet-05-array-member
