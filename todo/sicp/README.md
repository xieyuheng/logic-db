# Logic programming in SICP

[**Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs)
is a classic text in computer science.

It has one section about logic programming :
- [sarabander-sicp](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/4_002e4.xhtml#g_t4_002e4)
- [official](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-29.html#%_sec_4.4)

I translate some of its examples to logic-db here.
